# Space Invaders
---
Space Invaders is a fixed shooter game in which the player moves a laser cannon horizontally across the bottom of the screen and fires at aliens overhead. The goal is to eliminate all of the aliens by shooting them. While the player has three lives, the game ends immediately if the invaders reach the bottom of the screen.The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles. As aliens are defeated, their movement and the game's music both speed up. Defeating all the aliens brings another wave which starts lower, a loop which can continue endlessly.
